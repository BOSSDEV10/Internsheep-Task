Purpose

TaskViewer is a dedicated portal created to present internship tasks and
completed work in a single interface.

Simple Workflow for Mentor

-   Open the live project link
-   Browse any task from the sidebar
-   View descriptions, images, and my submitted solutions directly on
    the site

shareable link without using Google Drive or downloading files
repeatedly. All tasks are organized and accessible online for quick and
easy viewing.
